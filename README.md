## 👋 Overview

A CLI-based AI chatbot that can answer questions, search the web, browse pages, and execute skill-based workflows.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Web Search & Browsing**: Access to web search and page browsing tools
- **Extensible Skills**: SKILL.md-based workflows for specialized tasks
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution


## ✅ Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.com) runtime (v1.0 or higher)
- OpenAI API key (get [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Exa API key (get [here](https://exa.ai)) - optional, for web search

#### Installing Bun

If you don't have Bun installed, you can install it using curl:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
```

**Windows:**
```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify Bun is installed:

```

## 💻 How to Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd chatbot
```

2. Install dependencies with Bun:
```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys (if using cloud providers)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key (optional)
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key (optional)
# XAI_API_KEY=your-xai-api-key (optional)
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key (optional)

# (Optional) If using Ollama locally
# OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434

# Web Search (Exa preferred, Tavily fallback)
# EXASEARCH_API_KEY=your-exa-api-key
# TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-api-key
```

## 🚀 How to Run

Run in interactive mode:
```bash
bun start
```

Or with watch mode for development:
```bash
bun dev
```

## 📊 How to Evaluate

Includes an evaluation suite that tests the agent against a dataset of questions. Evals use LangSmith for tracking and an LLM-as-judge approach for scoring correctness.

**Run on all questions:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts
```

**Run on a random sample of data:**
```bash
bun run src/evals/run.ts --sample 10
```

The eval runner displays a real-time UI showing progress, current question, and running accuracy statistics. Results are logged to LangSmith for analysis.

## 🐛 How to Debug

All tool calls are logged to a scratchpad file for debugging and history tracking. Each query creates a new JSONL file in `.dexter/scratchpad/`.

**Scratchpad location:**
```
.dexter/scratchpad/
├── 2026-01-30-111400_9a8f10723f79.jsonl
├── 2026-01-30-143022_a1b2c3d4e5f6.jsonl
└── ...
```

Each file contains newline-delimited JSON entries tracking:
- **init**: The original query
- **tool_result**: Each tool call with arguments, raw result, and LLM summary
- **thinking**: Agent reasoning steps

## 📱 How to Use with WhatsApp

Chat through WhatsApp by linking your phone to the gateway. Messages you send to yourself are processed by the chatbot and responses are sent back to the same chat.

**Quick start:**
```bash
# Link your WhatsApp account (scan QR code)
bun run gateway:login

# Start the gateway (runs under Node for WhatsApp reliability)
bun run gateway
```

Then open WhatsApp, go to your own chat (message yourself), and ask a question.

For detailed setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting, see the [WhatsApp Gateway README](src/gateway/channels/whatsapp/README.md).
